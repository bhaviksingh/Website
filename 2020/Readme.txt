HTML5 Reader for Electric Zine Maker version 20.4

Made by Jeremy Oduber in 2019 and 2020 to have a web and mobile friendly way to show off EZM zines on itch.io.

---------------------------------------

Instructions:
-Copy the PNG files from your Electric Zine Maker save folder into the 'pages' folder with their original filenames.
-If you're not using the default EZM template, change the TEMPLATE constant in ezmreader.js. (Open it with notepad or your favorite code editor)
    Available templates:
        1: 8 page folded zine or z-fold
        2: 18 page square accordion zine
		3: 16 page mini-booklet
		4: 16 page micro-mini
-To change the background color, modify the hex value in the BGCOLOR constant in ezmreader.js.
-Compress the whole thing into a zip file and upload to itch.io as an HTML project that will be played in the browser.
-Set the viewport dimension to 900 x 650.
-If you want it to be mobile friendly, set the orientation to Landscape.

Turn pages with arrow keys or A&D, or click/tap on page edges.

---------------------------------------

Built with Three.js, GSAP, a bunch of tutorials, and good ol' perseverance.
Feel free to modify and distribute and link to as your heart desires, and don't let anyone EVER stop you.
